Functional requirements are categorised using the MoSCoW model.
The MoSCoW model consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Must-haves:\\
    Must-haves must be implemented during the alpha and must be finished
    before the beta starts.
  \item Should-haves:\\
    Should-haves must be implemented during the beta and must be finished
    before the product is released.
  \item Could-haves:\\
    Could-haves should be implemented during the beta if all should-haves are
    implemented. All other remaining could-haves should be implemented during
    incremental release cycles.
  \item Wont-haves:\\
    Wont-haves will not be implemented. They are stated to clearly describe
    what features the tool is not designed for.
\end{enumerate}
